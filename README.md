### What is a Framework?

A framework is a bundle of code that forms the skeleton or foundation for your project. It offers a structure and common ground for development, making it easier to build robust and high-quality applications.

### Why Use Spring?

Spring is favored for several reasons:

- **Speeds up development:** By providing a pre-made structure, it cuts down on development time.
- **Ensures quality:** The framework's structure ensures a certain level of quality from the start.

The evolution from server-centric to client-centric models emphasizes lightweight, productive, and stable applications.

### Choosing Spring

Spring stands out for being a relatively lightweight framework, especially when compared to heavyweight enterprise-level frameworks like EJB, which are known for their complexity. Spring makes it easier to integrate various functionalities with minimal fuss and supports a diverse range of development tools for increased productivity.

### Historical Milestones:

- **Spring 2.5:** Enabled annotation configuration.
- **Spring 3.0:** Introduced the ability to use Java classes for configuration.
- **Spring 4.0:** Added support for REST-style controllers.
- **Spring 5.0:** Brought in support for Reactive style development using Reactor.

### Key Features of Spring

- **POJO-Based Configuration:** Simplifies development by not requiring a separate API for object relationships.
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Manages object creation and their lifecycles, simplifying configuration and integration.
- **AOP Support:** Allows separation of concerns, particularly for cross-cutting concerns such as transactions and logging.
- **Convenient MVC Framework:** Provides a comprehensive model-view-controller architecture for creating web applications.
- **Non-WAS Dependent:** Enables development in environments not tied to a specific Web Application Server.

Spring's architecture ensures that your application remains lightweight, agile, and easy to test, making it an excellent choice for enterprise application development.
